# UF-Rewriter: Intelligent Query Transformation

Unlock precision in search and RAG with AI-powered query rewriting. Simple to deploy, powerful in action.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/UltrafilterAI/uf-rewriter)

## ‚ú® **Our Philosophy**

Great search starts with a great query.

We built UF-Rewriter to solve a problem we faced in our own RAG systems. It‚Äôs a simple, powerful tool for query rewriting, and we‚Äôre sharing it because we believe it can help others build better search experiences too.

To fit different workflows, we designed three modes:

*   **Simple Mode:** For quick, on-the-fly rewriting.
*   **Template Mode:** For consistent, repeatable results in production.
*   **Advanced Mode:** For fine-tuned control with detailed Markdown prompts.

## üåç **Live Demo: Try it Now**

Experience the magic. Replace `https://uf-rewriter-staging.ultrafilterai.workers.dev` with your deployed worker URL.

```bash
curl -X POST https://uf-rewriter-staging.ultrafilterai.workers.dev \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "machine learning tutorial",
    "prompt": "Rewrite for educational content search optimization"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "rewritten": "best machine learning tutorials for beginners"
}
```


## üöÄ **Quick Start: From Zero to Deployed**

Get your AI-powered query rewriter live in minutes. It's easier than brewing coffee.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 16+, a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up), and a [Gemini API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

```bash
# Clone, install, and auto-configure (it'll ask for your API key and optional custom domain)
git clone https://github.com/UltrafilterAI/uf-rewriter
cd uf-rewriter
npm install
npm run setup

# Deploy to production (your API is now live globally!)
npm run deploy:production
```

**Note:** By default, your worker deploys to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain (e.g., `your-worker.your-username.workers.dev`). This is perfect for most global users. If you need a custom domain, especially for users in China, see the next section.

## üåèüá®üá≥ **Custom Domain Setup (Mandatory for China Users)**

While `.workers.dev` subdomains work for most global users, they are often inaccessible or perform poorly in mainland China. For users in China, a custom domain is **mandatory** for reliable access.

**Steps to configure a custom domain:**

1.  **Acquire a Custom Domain:** You must own a domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) and have it added to the **same Cloudflare account** where you are deploying this worker.

2.  **Run the Setup Script:** Execute the setup script. When prompted, enter your desired custom subdomain (e.g., `worker.yourdomain.com`).

    ```bash
    npm run setup
    # Follow the prompts and enter your custom domain when asked.
    ```

3.  **Deploy to Production:** Deploy your worker. Wrangler will automatically configure the necessary DNS records for your custom domain.

    ```bash
    npm run deploy:production
    ```

    Your worker will then be accessible at `https://worker.yourdomain.com` (replace with your actual domain).

4.  **Enable China Network (Optional, for best performance):** For optimal performance and reliability in mainland China, consider enabling Cloudflare's China Network. This requires:
    *   Your Cloudflare account to be on an **Enterprise plan**.
    *   You must have a valid **ICP license** for your domain.
    *   Contact Cloudflare support to enable the **China Network** for your zone.

This will ensure your API is fast and accessible for users in China.
