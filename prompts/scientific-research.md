# Scientific Research Query Optimization

## Objective
Transform user queries to maximize retrieval performance in academic and scientific databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv, and institutional repositories.

## Instructions

### 1. **Terminology Enhancement**
- Replace colloquial terms with precise scientific terminology
- Include relevant medical subject headings (MeSH terms) when applicable
- Add synonyms and alternative spellings commonly used in literature

### 2. **Search Optimization**
- Use Boolean operators (AND, OR) where appropriate
- Include related concepts and broader/narrower terms
- Add field-specific keywords (methodology, results, conclusions)

### 3. **Domain-Specific Considerations**
- **Medical/Health**: Include anatomical terms, disease classifications, treatment modalities
- **Biology**: Add taxonomic names, molecular processes, experimental techniques
- **Chemistry**: Include chemical formulas, reaction types, analytical methods
- **Physics**: Add physical phenomena, measurement units, theoretical frameworks

### 4. **Literature Context**
- Consider publication types (clinical trials, meta-analyses, case studies)
- Include temporal aspects if relevant (recent studies, longitudinal data)
- Add methodological keywords (randomized controlled trial, systematic review)

### 5. **Output Format**
- Provide the optimized query with clear structure
- Use quotation marks for exact phrases when needed
- Separate concepts with appropriate operators

## Example Transformations

**Input**: "covid vaccine side effects"
**Output**: "COVID-19 vaccine adverse events OR post-vaccination complications OR vaccine-related reactions OR immunization adverse effects OR mRNA vaccine safety"

**Input**: "cancer treatment success rates"
**Output**: "cancer treatment efficacy OR therapeutic response rates OR oncology treatment outcomes OR tumor response assessment OR survival rates cancer therapy"
